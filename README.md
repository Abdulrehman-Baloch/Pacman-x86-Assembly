# 🟡 Classic Pac-Man in x86 Assembly Language

Hey there, fellow gamers and assembly warriors! Welcome to my take on the **Classic Pac-Man** game, crafted with love (and maybe a few too many snacks) using **x86 assembly language**. Get ready to navigate the maze, munch on pellets, and dodge some rather persistent ghosts! 

## 🎮 Game Overview

In this nostalgic adventure, you’ll take control of our round yellow hero, Pac-Man, as he zooms around a maze filled with delicious pellets. The mission? Eat all the pellets and avoid getting caught by the four ghosts. Don’t worry, though; you can gobble up power pellets to temporarily turn the tables and chase them down for some sweet revenge. 

I’d also like to apologize to the assembly warriors out there for my (probably) terrible assembly. Let’s just say my assembly skills are like Pac-Man after eating a power pellet: a bit unpredictable! 😅

## ✨ Key Features

- **Maze Navigation**: Explore a classic maze layout filled with dots, power pellets, and fruits. It’s like a buffet but for Pac-Man!
- **Ghost AI**: Challenge yourself against four ghosts, each with their own quirks. They may not be the brightest bulbs, but they’re certainly persistent!
- **Power-Ups**: Collect power pellets to gain temporary invincibility and chase down the ghosts for extra points. Revenge never tasted so good!
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score as you devour pellets and outsmart enemies, aiming for that coveted high score. May the best ghost-chaser win!
- **Simple Controls**: Use intuitive keyboard controls to navigate. Seriously, if you can press an arrow key, you’re good to go!
- **Retro Graphics**: Enjoy charming, minimalist graphics that bring back all the feels of classic arcade gaming.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Language**: Developed in x86 assembly language. Yes, I’ve entered the matrix, and it’s a wild ride!
- **Direct Hardware Interaction**: Utilizing direct screen output and keyboard input for that authentic retro gaming experience.
- **Efficient Code**: Just like Pac-Man, I’m trying to keep things as lean as possible!

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this game, you’ll need:

- An x86-compatible environment (you know, the good old days!)
- An assembler (like NASM or MASM) to put it all together
- An emulator (like DOSBox) to run the game


## 🎹 Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move Pac-Man in the corresponding direction (up, down, left, right). Just don’t try to make him moonwalk; it won’t end well!
- **Esc**: Quit the game. But who would want to do that? You’re having fun, right? 😜
